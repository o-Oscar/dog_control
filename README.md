All the stuff you need to control a robot dog.

## TODO

Goal : having a simple controller that flings the motors around in sim and in real life.

TODO :
-> Finish the object separation between the observer and the controller (simple is good)
-> Replicate the structure of the code of IdefX for a simulation using mujoco.

## Status

### mmjcf creation

A first version has been coded. Still needs to match the real robot.
